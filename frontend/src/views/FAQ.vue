      <h2>Q: Do you have any restrictions on seating during the pandemic?</h2>

      <p>
         A: Currently we do not have any seating restrictions. However, this
         might change in the near future. We are currently looking into how to
         best implement seating restrictions. Please always make sure to wash
         your hands and wear a mask for your safety and the safety of your
         fellow movie-goers. We do not let persons with flu-like symptoms
         entrance.

      <h2>Q: How do I book a ticket?</h2>

      <p>
         A: Choose a movie either by clicking on a smaller image in the start
         page or in the "movies" page. From there you want to pick a date and
         time to see the movie by pressing on the corresponding "Book" button.
         Then you choose which seat(s) you want by pressing on the seat(s) in
         the seating map. Then you choose your ticket types and press "Next".
         Then you will have to confirm your booking information by pressing
         "Continue". Remember to print out your booking information or save it
         in your phone so that you can identify yourself when buying your ticket
         at the cinema.
      </p>

      <h2>Q: Why do you have so few movies to choose from?</h2>

      <p>
         A: We are a small independent movie theatre company that focuses on
         showing quality movies instead of having a large quantity of movies to
         show. This means that we also sometimes show exclusive movies from
         local producers.
      </p>

      <h2>Q: Do you sell drinks and snacks at the theatres?</h2>

      <p>
         A: Yes we do. We have a variety of candies, flavored popcorn, chips,
         sandwhiches and carbonated drinks for sale at a good price in our
         snacks bar. Make sure to bring your premium membership card with you to
         the snacks bar as it gives a discount.
      </p>

      <h2>Q: Are your foods and drinks ethically sourced?</h2>

      <p>
         A: Yes, they are both fair-trade and organic. We also compensate 120%
         for our carbon footprint by planting trees.
      </p>

      <h2>
         Q: Are your facilities accessible for people with physical
         disabilities?
      </h2>

      <p>
         A: Yes, we have ramps wherever there are stairs, braille written on
         every sign, handicap parking nearby, a section in each theatre for
         wheelchairs and handicap restrooms.
      </p>

      <h2>Q: Do you have a premium membership?</h2>

      <p>
         A: Yes we do! We have a premium membership for guests that want to go
         to the movies more than once a month. Please speak with your closest
         movie theatre staff for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>
         Q: Do you have any recommendations for someone going to the movies for
         their first time?
      </h2>

      <p>
         A: It is always good to be a little prepared before going to the show.
         Make sure you are not hungry, and if you are there are snacks and other
         food items that you can buy at our snack bar. Make sure to also go to
         the restroom before going to the show. And please wash your hands and
         make sure to wear a mask for Your safety and the safety of your fellow
         guests.

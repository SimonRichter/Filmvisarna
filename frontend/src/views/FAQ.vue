      <h2>Q: How do I book a ticket?</h2>
      <p class="answer">
         A: Choose a movie either by clicking on a smaller image in the start
         page or in the "movies" page. From there you want to pick a date and
         time to see the movie by pressing on the corresponding "Book" button.
         Then you choose which seat(s) you want by pressing on the seats in the
         seating map. Then you choose your ticket types and press "Next". Then
         you will have to confirm your booking information by pressing
         "Continue". Remember to print out your booking information or save it
         in your phone so that you can identify yourself when buying your ticket
         at the cinema.

      <h2>Q: Why do you have so few movies to choose from?</h2>

      <p class="answer">
         A: We are a small independent movie theatre company that focuses on
         showing quality movies instead of having a large quantity of movies to
         show.
